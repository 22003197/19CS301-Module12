## STACK USING LINKED LIST-2

### AIM

To write a python code to insert 3 elements. Also check and print the index value of the elements stored in the stack.

### ALORITHM 

1. Start the program.

2. Initialize an empty list stack.

3. Push elements "a", "b", and "c" onto the stack using append().

4. Print the initial stack.

5. Loop through the stack.

6. Print the index i and the element at that index stack[i].

7. Terminate the program.

### PROGRAM

```
stack = []
stack.append("a")
stack.append("b")
stack.append("c")

print('Initial stack: ' + str(stack))

for i in range(len(stack)):
    print(i,end=" ")
    print(stack[i])
```
