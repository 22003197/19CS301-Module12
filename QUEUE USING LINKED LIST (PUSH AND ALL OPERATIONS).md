## QUEUE USING LINKED LIST (PUSH AND ALL OPERATIONS)

### AIM

To write a python code to add 4 elements in a queue and print the element present in the front and rear of queue.

### ALORITHM 

1. Start the program.

2. Initialize an empty list queue.

3. Insert elements 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' into the queue using append().

4. Print the initial queue.

5. Access the front element (first item) using queue[0] and print it.

queue = []
queue.append('a')
queue.append('b')
queue.append('c')
